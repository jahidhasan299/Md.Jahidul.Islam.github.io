📚 I am a first year PhD student working on Medical Imaging at the University of Chinese Academy of Science. My work is funded by the [Paul C Lauterbur Research Center](http://english.siat.cas.cn/) and supervised by [Prof. Shanshan Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8pnz5L4AAAAJ&hl=en). 
Previously, I completed MSc in 👨🏻‍💻 Software Engineering at [Northeastern University](http://sc.neu.edu.cn/english/), China, and a BSc in 👨🏻‍💻 Software Engineering at [Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://software-en.cqupt.edu.cn/), China.

🔬 My research interests are in analysis the medical images and multi-modalities and Self-Supervised Learning!. 📚 I'm currently working towards my research project in the field of Vision-Language-Modelling.
📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.
